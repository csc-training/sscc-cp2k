    "# Part 2: Vibrational analysis of the transition state\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition state (TS) is a first-order saddle-point on the multi-dimensional potential energy surface (PES). In other words, it is a maximum along the reaction path and a minimum in all other directions. This means that a vibrational analysis of the TS should yield exactly one imaginary vibrational mode. This technique is frequently used to verify that a TS was really found."
