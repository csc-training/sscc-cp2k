    "# Proton transfer simulations with CP2K\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will study the interconversion between the two enol forms of 2-formylcyclohexanone using DFT calculations powered by the CP2K software package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Any reaction that **only** involves intramolecular proton transfer is called *tautomerism*. Carbonyl compounds are typical examples, which may exist in *keto* and *enol* forms:\n",

    "    <img src=\"../img/keto-enol.png\" style=\"width: 660px\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Keto–enol equilibrium typically lies heavily towards the keto form. However, **1,3-dicarbonyl compounds** are exceptional due to thermodynamically favorable enolization enabled by *conjugation* and *intramolecular hydrogen bonding*.\n",

    "[CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org) is a versatile software suite for massively parallel quantum chemistry calculations and, in particular, *ab initio* molecular dynamics simulations. CP2K implements DFT using the *mixed Gaussian and plane waves* (GPW) method, where the electron density is represented using plane waves while the valence orbitals are expanded in a Gaussian basis. This allows leveraging both analytical integral relations for Gaussians as well as fast Fourier transforms for electrostatics and the exchange–correlation interaction in the plane wave basis.\n",

    "## Part 1: Minimum energy path from nudged elastic band calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Nudged elastic band (NEB) is a method for finding the minimum energy path between two equilibrium structures. Here, a discrete band of \"images\" connecting the initial (IS) and final states (FS) is constructed with a harmonic potential included between each pair of images to keep the band continuous and images equidistant. This band is then optimized so that each image finds the lowest energy possible while maintaining the previous constraints.\n",
